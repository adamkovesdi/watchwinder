# watchwinder
Arduino based LCD display automatic watch winder  
This project is work in progress, core functionality is there but needs some more TLC  

## What's working
- Wind interval calculation
- Wind counting
- I2c bus RTC support for accurate timing
- Stepper motor driver
- LCD display
- Current time printout
- Wind counter
- Next wind scheduling

## What's not that good yet
- Wind direction support
- Proper winding pattern
- Wrap up the whole stuff into something organized
